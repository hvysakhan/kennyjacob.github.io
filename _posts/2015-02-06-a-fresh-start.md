Howdy folks. Just injecting a breath of fresh air by jumping onto github pages to host my blog. My old [blog on blogger](http://mewnip.blogspot.com) seems too archaic by today's standards, especially in the design department, which is what everyone notices first. There are waaay too many good things happenning in life that I really had to make this shift which is in a way one of the many changes I'm making to my old routines.
