Hi there! :) 


Thanks for dropping by. This blog is meant to be a place to experiment with **git**, **github** and other awesome stuff online. I'll be rambling about random stuff that life throws at me.


This blog is hosted on *GitHub Pages*. Posts are written in *Markdown*. If you're new to git and github, you can

	1. Fork this repo
	2. Clone it to your computer
	3. Running it locally
	4. Make an edit or create a new post
	5. Commit
	6. Push
	7. Create a pull request
	
### 1. Fork this repo

To fork this repo, just go [here](https://github.com/kennyjacob/kennyjacob.github.io) and click on the *fork* button at the top right.

### 2. Cloning it

Make sure you have git installed on your computer.

Then run 

	git clone URL
where URL should be replaced by the url of the newly forked repo.

### 3. Running it locally

Make sure you have ruby installed. Then do,

	gem install jekyll
	
Once jekyll is installed, go to the cloned directory and run

	jekyll serve

### 4. Editing

Use any normal text editor to edit posts.

### 5. Commit

You can commit by doing

	1. git status
		This will tell you which files have to be added.
		
	2. git add <files>
		Run git add on all the files that are to be added.
		
	3. git commit -m "Give a meaningful message here"
